### :scroll: Description:

This is a LinkedIn clone web app. Fully adaptive. Choose your google account and start posting. Add photos, videos and search for interesting posts.

### :astronaut: User guide:

1. Log in with your Google account (it’s safe, app doesn’t see or store your password - I use Next Auth module).
2. Choose light or dark mode.
3. Add new posts, you can also attach photos using url link.
4. To add a video to your post be sure your YouTube link looks like this:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im2DetQWs24&t=226s&ab_channel=ChrisLuno.
5. Delete your post or make new one.
6. Search through added posts (to show all posts again just clear input add push to search).
7. Logout by pushing your profile icon.
